# Surprise Housing Assignment
This repository contains the code and data for the Surprise Housing assignment for Executive PG Programme in Machine Learning & AI - February 2023 course. The assignment consists of two parts: Part-I, which is a programming assignment, and Part-II, which includes subjective questions.

## Problem Statement
Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company, wants to enter the Australian market and purchase properties below their actual values to sell them at a higher price. The task is to develop a regression model that can accurately predict house prices and help the company decide whether to invest in prospective properties.

## Part-I: Regression Model for Property Price Prediction
In Part-I, the goal is to build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the actual value of prospective properties in the Australian market. The provided dataset contains information about the sale of houses in Australia.

## Key Objectives
- Identify significant variables that affect house prices.
- Assess the effectiveness of these variables in predicting house prices.
- Determine the optimal values of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Part-II: Subjective Questions
Part-II of the assignment consists of subjective questions that need to be answered in a PDF file.

## Results and Findings
The analysis aims to identify the significant variables that impact house prices and assess their predictive power. The regression models built using regularization techniques provide insights into the pricing dynamics of the Australian housing market. The optimal values of lambda for ridge and lasso regression are determined to enhance the model's performance.
